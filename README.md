I´m 62 years old, studying Information Systems because I work in this area , about 25 years, since 1993. After begin to study Electrical Engeneering for two times, UFAM(UA-1978) and UEA(2003), when I decided to get into an universty again I found this course and that was "what I was lookng for", then since that, I´m making a big effort to keep me there and try to finish the course.
